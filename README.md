# PegSolitaire

This program simulates many games of Peg Solitaire. The goals of this program were:
 1) Find a winning path for many different Peg Solitaire boards, such as French Solitaire, English Solitaire, and Triangular Solitaire.
 2) Determine the win rate at each board by simulating many games on a specific board using strictly random moves. Then with this information, determine which boards are the most difficult and which are the easiest to solve
 3) Make a modification to the program to improve the win rate of a board.

 Please see the write up PegSolitaireWriteUp.pdf in the PegSolitairePaper folder for a detailed explanation on the purpose and discoveries of this program.
