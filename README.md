# Peg Solitaire

This program simulates many games of Peg Solitaire. The goals of this program were:
 1) Find a winning path for many different Peg Solitaire boards, such as French Solitaire, English Solitaire, and Triangular Solitaire.
 2) Determine the win rate at each board by simulating many games on a specific board using strictly random moves. Then with this information, determine which boards are the most difficult and which are the easiest to solve.
 3) Make a modification to the program to improve the win rate of a board.

The program can be run by downloading the files and typing the command line arguments, the type (F E or T), the board size (odd integer, best results with 5,7, or 9), and the row and column of initial empty space. For example:   "./run.sh T 5 1 0".
